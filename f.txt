show the layout of a cache for a CPU that can address 256k*8 of data; the cache holds 16K*8 data and has the following mapping strategies.
Give the number of bits per location and the total number of locations.
a.fully associative 
b.Four-Way set associative
ans:-
(i) fully associative
Tag(18)|Word(3)|
18bit (Tag)|8bit data|1 valid bit in total (27 bit)

(ii) 4-way associative
Tag(2)|set(16)|word(3)
2 bit (Tag)|8 bit data|1 valid bit (4 times)in total (11*4 bit)
